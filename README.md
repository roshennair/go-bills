# Go Bills - Restaurant Bill Generator

A simple CLI application built in Go which generates a bill from user input and saves it in a TXT file. I built this application in order to learn the basics of the Go programming language.

**DISCLAIMER**: I did not design this application myself, I created it as a code-along project for The Net Ninja's amazing tutorial series, [Go Tutorial (Golang) for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gC88BEo9czgyS72A3doDeM).

To run go-bills in your command line: 
```bash
go build -o go-bills && ./go-bills
```
